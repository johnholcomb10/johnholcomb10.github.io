## About this Website

This is my portfolio website, made as a project for my CSC 4330 (Software Systems Development) course at LSU. It was created using standard HTML/CSS and Bootstrap, a CSS framework for responsive, front-end web development. The site highlights my job experience, education, projects, and awards. I plan on updating the site regularly, and the date of last update is present on the welcoming alert and in the footer.
